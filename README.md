My Journey and notes on All My AWS Certifications
## Notes Or Rankings On Difficulty Per Course
## topup Dublication
Having taken the majority of __AWS Associate/Speciality/Professional certifications__, in this article, I rank all AWS certifications in increasing order of difficulty levels according to my exam experience. This article can also serve as a learning path for AWS. 

1. Practitioner:
This one is for AWS newbies and non-engineers. The certification covers a wide range of AWS services for a beginner-level exam, hence one does need to prepare well.
3. Solutions Architect Associate:
This exam requires a good understanding of what combination of AWS services to use for a given scenario, with some hands-on practice.
4. Developer Associate:
At par with Solution Architect in terms of difficulty. This exam drills deeper into security and CI/CD concepts.
6. Sysops Associate:
The toughest among associate-level exams. Focusses more on deployment and configuration aspects of AWS services.
8. Data Engineer Associate
This is a newly launched exam. I have not taken it myself, but have heard feedback that this is a very tough exam for an associate level.
10. Security Speciality:
A good understanding of security concepts is required to clear the associate-level exams. Hence moving over to the specialty level after clearing Associate level exams, the AWS 8. 8. Security Specialty exam feels like a low-hanging fruit.
12. Database Speciality:
Not among the difficult ones, but you do need to invest time to prepare for this one.
14. DevOps Professional:
Things start to get very difficult from here. 75-question format for Professional exams adds to the overall difficulty of these exams. This exam requires a good level of hands-on practice.
16. Data Analytics Speciality:
This exam can be a hard nut to crack if you don't have a Big-Data background. Some knowledge of big data is a prerequisite for this exam. 
18. Solutions Architect Professional:
Another 75-question exam, with many lengthy questions and confusing options, makes this one of the toughest exams out there.
20. Machine Learning Speciality:
This exam requires sound knowledge of ML concepts. It is very different from other AWS exams. It not only covers AWS services but also has many questions on machine learning concepts. Taking the Data Analytics Speciality exam before planning for this one may help.
22. Networking Speciality:
The lack of hands-on practice on some of the expensive services covered in this exam (Direct Connect, Transit Gateway, etc.) makes it hard to grasp all concepts. Additionally, the exam was updated a few months back, taking the difficulty to another level altogether and making this one the toughest nut to crack.

For anyone considering AWS certifications for the first time, this article might help.
